	abstract = {Wireless sensor networks {(WSN)}, an element of pervasive computing, are presently being used on a large scale to monitor real-time environmental status. However these sensors operate under extreme energy constraints and are designed by keeping an application in mind. Designing a new wireless sensor node is extremely challenging task and involves assessing a number of different parameters required by the target application, which includes range, antenna type, target technology, components, memory, storage, power, life time, security, computational capability, communication technology, power, size, programming interface and applications. This paper analyses commercially (and research prototypes) available wireless sensor nodes based on these parameters and outlines research directions in this area.},
